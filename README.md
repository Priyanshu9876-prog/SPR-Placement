# SPR-Placement
DBMS project

SPR Placement is a small web application to track students’ placement and internship status (offers, internships, progress reports).
Backend is a Flask + SQLAlchemy API (deployed on Render). Frontend is a React (Vite) app (deployable to Vercel) — or a simple static HTML/CSS/JS alternative is included.
